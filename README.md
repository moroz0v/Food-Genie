# Food-Genie
This app will use your geo location to suggest spots to eat nearby by using Google Places API and will track your feedback. Or if you are in the mood for something more specific, you can give Genie a few pointers and he will find something you and your friends can all agree on.

###Features
This is what FoodGenie can do:

##### Suggesting places to eat
Auto suggest places based on your location and time of day, great if you are feeling open-minded.

##### Compare results
Select a few choices from the results, swype to the left and you are shown the list you can share with your fiends. Get their oppinion to narrow down choices!

##### Extended place info
See place details and reviews by tapping on the name of the place.

##### Keep track of your favorites
Keep track on places you went to by tapping "go here" button. Those places will be saved to your Visited Places. They will show up in a different color in your search results. 

##### Manage your places
You can add/remove reviews and blacklist a place. If you blacklist a place, it won't show up in search results next time! You can un-blacklist a place or edit a place review from Visited Places as well.

###Known Issues
1. Once "go here" is pressed, back button closes the app.
2. Back button persists on the Home Screen
3. Larger screens aren't utilized to their full potential... Yet!
4. UI gives an option to compare visited places but it doesn't work.
5. UI can use some Material Design love.
6. No real proper error handling.

###Special thanks to
